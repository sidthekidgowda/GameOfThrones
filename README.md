# GameOfThrones

I love Game of Thrones and was a big fan of the show. But I've never read any of the books. 

I decided to make an app that can list all the books that are part of the Game of Thrones world.

I used the api https://www.anapioficeandfire.com to retrieve all the information for this application.

The application makes a service call to get all the books and saves the result to disk using Room as a database provider.

This app was written fully in Kotlin.

### Technologies used: 
Android Architecture Components(Room/LiveData/ViewModel), RxJava, Dagger, Retrofit, Gson
